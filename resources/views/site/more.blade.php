            <p>Smoking is major health risk, but still people give different reasons for smoking most of these justifications are not very reasonable. Smoking is mostly starts at young age because teenagers think that if they start smoking they will be considered as mature, but of course they are wrong and causing serious health risk for themselves. Smoking by many is way to relax, but it comes with greater health risk for damaging the brain. Smoking is very bad habit thus it should be quitted by people, smoker don’t risk their lives but lives of other which inhale the smoke (Greaves, 2002).

            Smoking effects differ from a person to another person depending upon exposure to chemicals of the cigarette. Smoking is not only public health issue, but also it has great financial cost on the nations. Until we stop smoking, more people will be addicted, more people will get sick, more families will be devastated by loss of loved ones, bring great damage to medical system of the nations. Harm of smoking on body of a person is enormous, and smoking should be ban from all public places. Smoking can easily make a body weak, and cause a slow and steady death. There many facts related to smoking and deaths, for instances in United States there were about 443,000 deaths by smoking, which is about one in five death every year.</p>  <p> t is also believed that each year more deaths happen due to smoking compared to combine the deaths by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), alcohol, suicides, illegal drugs, murder and vehicle injuries. Due to smoking ninety percent of all lung cancer in men is caused, and eighty percent of all lung cancer deaths in women. It is also estimated that deaths ninety percent of all deaths by chronic obstructive lung diseases are caused by smoking.

            Human body is very vulnerable to harmful effects of smoking, and it can harm our heart, lungs, blood circulation, bones, stomach, mouth, eyes, skin, reproduction and fertility. Smoking effect on heart and lung in very serious manner, in case of heart nicotine raises blood pressure and blood gets clot easily. Carbon monoxide raids the blood of oxygen and causes development of cholesterol deposits in artery walls. In case of lungs smoking causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) which is group of disease that includes asthmatic bronchitis and emphysema. Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) are well known as silent killer diseases. Most of smokers don’t know that they are affected by it until it is too late to save them. There is no cure for such type of diseases and almost fifteen percent of smokers develop chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD). Harm to blood circulation start at by smoking, and veins and arteries get hard, narrow, and also get coated by fat deposits. This can then lead to problems such as cold skin, ulcer, cramps, pain and blockages in veins which can cause a stroke and heart attack. Smoking makes bones weak and breakable, and women need to be careful because they are more likely to suffer by osteoporosis than non-smokers. Smoking can harm stomach, eyes and skin. Stomach damages can affect vital organs in the body, and increase the chance of stomach cancer. There are even more danger for eyes such as eye diseases related to Graves’ ophthalmopathy, glaucoma and cataract. Worst thing which can be done by smoking is causing a permanent blindness. Smoking lessens the amount of oxygen for the skin. This can mean that skin start to age more quickly and making you look like dull and grey. Smoking effect on reproduction and fertility are very serious. Smoking can increase risk of feebleness, and can damage sperm by reducing sperm count and casing testicular cancer (Team, 2009)</p><p>.

            Everybody knows the harm of smoking but nobody cares to stop it, this attitude towards smoking should be changed. Smoking is vilest habit of about 1.2 billion which are addicted to smoking. It has no benefit for smoker and the society. Smoking impact on society is beyond health and illness. Smoking regularly impacts the financial resources of smoker especially when people have limited resources. For instance in England economically poor households spend about 2.5 percent of income on smoking per week. It is believed that economic burden of smoking exceeds one percent of European GDP. Society has to pay the cost of smoking by morbidity and mortality. Direct cost of smoking is related to health care and indirect cost is related to the loss of human capital due to premature deaths, productivity losses, and unpaid income taxes. Currently estimate the total smoking attribute cost of two leading groups of smoking related diseases in COPD and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD), amount between 105.83 to 130.31 billion euros. In Australia smoking net social cost is between 2.1 to 3.4 percent of their GDP (Kaiser S, 2009 ).

            Smoking effect on children and teens are intense. Smoking passively can impair child’s ability at mathematics and reading by leading researchers claims. Study of smoking environment is essential, and one such study shows that if people at home smoke regularly then children get low marks in test. In journal of Environmental Health Perspectives measure that exposer to smoking at home leads to cotinine in children. Cotinine is common in children by second-hand smoke. Exposer of smoking at home to children is important issue which government must resolve to keep the children’s safe (Society Guardian, 2005 ). </p><p>Teenager starts to smoke at very young age thus cause the buildup foundation of diseases in their bodies. Teenage at large think smoking as fashionable thing and get involved in smoking. Children and teenager are building blocks of our society if they are in safe environment then society are in safe environment. Implication of life is lost due to smoking, and as result average person’s loses 10 to 15 minute of exquisite life whenever smoking. Smoking is largest preventable cause of unwanted deaths around the world. Smoking cause more than twenty five diseases and most of them are life intimidating, and strappingly suspected to relate to smoking. Average smoking reduces the total life expectancy to 6.8 years, heavy smoking reduces the total life expectancy to 8.8 years. Furthermre smoking reduced the number of disease free life by 5.8 years. Stop smoking at age of forty and increase your life expectancy to 4.6 years(Baijal, 2010).</p>
